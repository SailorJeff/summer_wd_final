## Refactors 1

1. Rename "container1" and "container2" to  "productContainer" and "productReviews" tobe more meaningful
2. Place productReviews inside productContainer so you can apply it to every product you created
3. Wrap product data in a div so it is separate from reviews
4. Clean up styling so the one product looks all aligned
5. Update all ids to classes so the styles can be applied to like items when we repeat this for all other products using JS
